    <h2>Care, Counseling, Coordination</h2>
    <p>Complex medical conditions often necessitate treatment from multiple health professionals across specializations. The coordination of multiple specialists often falls on the patient, who may also encounter barriers to transportation, comprehension, or financial access. United Health Partners offers care coordination and counseling services to specialty medical patients struggling to navigate the complexities of their care.</p>

    <h2>Complex Pharmacy Management</h2>

    <h2>Description of 340B program</h2>
    <p>The 340B Drug Pricing Program provides financial assistance to medical facilities serving vulnerable communities to increase access to prescription drugs</p>
    <p>
      According to 340B of the Public Health Service Act, healthcare organizations that service many low-income or uninsured patients are eligible for discounted prices on outpatient drugs sold by drug manufacturers participating in Medicaid. Several types of hospitals may qualify including sole community hospitals (SCHs), critical access hospitals (CAHs), rural referral centers (RRCs), and public and nonprofit disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) that treat low-income patients as well as federal grantee organizations. The program was designed to offer outpatient pharmaceuticals at more affordable prices for patients, expanding access to health services to underserved communities and patient populations.
