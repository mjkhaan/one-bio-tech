It can be challenging for patients with highly specialized medical conditions to navigate the healthcare delivery system.

  <h2>Our Partners</h2>
  <p>United Health Partners emerged from a multi-state primary care scaleup organization serving approximately 500,000 patients. Here, the team learned first-hand the challenges that those with highly specialized needs encounter in obtaining care. Without a liaison, patients with complex conditions struggle to navigate the healthcare delivery system, payors, and independent providers. Offering customized clinical and administrative support for patients with clinically complex conditions, United Health Partners empowers providers with the tools to best serve their most highly specialized patient populations.</p>
